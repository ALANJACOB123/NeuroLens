# NeuroLens - Brainwave-Based Adaptive Learning System

NeuroLens is an adaptive e-learning system that personalizes content in real-time based on brainwave signals, using non-invasive EEG devices and machine learning algorithms.

## Project Modules
- EEG Data Acquisition
- Preprocessing & Artifact Removal
- Feature Extraction (PSD, Entropy)
- Machine Learning-Based Classification
- Real-Time LMS API Integration
- VS Code Inline Learning Extension

## Setup
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Connect EEG device via BrainFlow
3. Run `stream_data.py`
4. Preprocess, extract features, and train model
5. Launch Flask server to connect LMS
6. Optionally install VS Code extension
